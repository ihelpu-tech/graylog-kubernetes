# Traefik
Traefik is the current ingress controller I'm using for graylog. More information can be found by watch Just me and Opensource's excellent video series: [Traefik v2 | Part 1 | How to deploy in Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/dEAtD9PVr_Q)

I may post more documentation here at a later date if I find it helpful.
